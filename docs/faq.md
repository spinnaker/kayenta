## Can you use Kayenta as a standalone service without the rest of Spinnaker?

Yes, Kayenta has an API that can be used to perform canary analysis outside of Spinnaker.
See [Kayenta Standalone](./kayenta-standalone.md) for more information.

## Where are the API docs?

When Kayenta is running, it serves its API docs at [http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui.html).

You can control what endpoints show up on that page via the [swagger config](../kayenta-web/config/kayenta.yml) section of the main config.
<!-- TODO explain how this is controlled in the yaml. -->
<!-- TODO add a cheat link to a generated yaml and add my postman collection. -->

This list may not encompass all current metric sources. [See the services that implement MetricService for current info.](https://github.com/spinnaker/kayenta/search?q=%22implements+MetricsService%22&unscoped_q=%22implements+MetricsService%22)

## How does Kayenta decide if a metric passes or fails?

Metric decisions are handled by the [judge](./canary-config.md#canary-judge-config) that you use.

### [NetflixACAJudge-v1.0](https://github.com/spinnaker/kayenta/blob/master/kayenta-judge/src/main/scala/com/netflix/kayenta/judge/NetflixACAJudge.scala)

This judge takes in metrics from a control group and an experiment group. It uses your [configuration settings](./canary-config.md#canary-analysis-configuration) to then [transform](https://github.com/spinnaker/kayenta/blob/master/kayenta-judge/src/main/scala/com/netflix/kayenta/judge/preprocessing/Transforms.scala) the data and apply the Mann Whitney U statistical test to determine the results.

See [Spinnaker Judge Docs](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/canary/judge/) for additional information.

## How do I report metrics in a way that is compatible with Kayenta and canary analysis?

See [Instrumenting Application Metrics For Kayenta](./instrumenting-application-metrics-for-kayenta.md).

## My metric failed and I don't agree with the results, can I change how sensitive Kayenta is to change?

_Warning: This is a beta feature and may be removed._

Yes, there are a couple of settings available for you.
See [EffectSize](./canary-config.md#effect-size) for more information.

## Why doesn't my Google account have access to get bucket metadata?

In order for Kayenta to read and write from a GCS bucket, it first needs to checks for the existence of the bucket. It does this by making a GET request to the `storage/v1/b/{bucket}` API which returns some metadata about the bucket. In order to interact with this API you need a role that has the `storage.buckets.get` permission. This permission used to be included in Google's [Standard Roles](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles), but has since been removed and put into [Legacy Roles](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles#legacy-roles). In order to get that permission, you can create a custom role and apply `storage.buckets.get` to it, add the `roles/storage.legacyBucketReader` as explained in the Legacy Roles section, or use the `roles/storage.admin` role.
