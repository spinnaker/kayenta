We prefer small, well tested pull requests.

Please refer to [Contributing to Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io/community/contributing/).

When filling out a pull request, please consider the following:

* Follow the commit message conventions [found here](https://spinnaker.io/community/contributing/submitting/).
* Provide a descriptive summary for your changes.
* If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.
* Add inline code comments to changes that might not be obvious.
* Squash your commits as you keep adding changes.
* Add a comment to @spinnaker/reviewers for review if your issue has been outstanding for more than 3 days.

Note that we are unlikely to accept pull requests that add features without prior discussion. The best way to propose a feature is to open an issue first and discuss your ideas there before implementing them.
