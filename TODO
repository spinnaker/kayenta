TODO:  Implement /canary endpoints

GET /canary/:configName -- get "recent" runs for this config.  Augment with params to allow pagination later.
    Future to allow selection of date range, and pagination.

GET /canary/:configName/:id/data -- get the data (the joined metric set) for this canary run
   This is used to validate the data from other scripts, not generally by the UI due to size.

GET /canary/:configName/:id/data/:metricUUID -- get just the data for the experiment+control for this one metric
   The metricUUID is assigned in the "id" field of the MetricSetPair, and is in the
   canary result object for that pair.
